# Balance / Token-List Refresh — Reference & Gaps

How the wallet UI keeps balances, the token list, and wallet content fresh
after a state-changing action (send, swap, stake, burn, switch, dApp tx, …),
and the four known gaps where the refresh is **delayed** rather than immediate.

> All gaps below are about **immediacy**, not permanent staleness: libwallet's
> background poller (~60 s) eventually reconciles everything. The gaps matter
> for the moment right after an action, when the user expects to see the result.

## 1. Architecture

There are **two data layers** that can go stale, refreshed by **two trigger
sources**.

### Data layers

| Layer | Lives in | Refreshed by | Reads from |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Headline balances** (SOL, ChiefPussy, fiat) | `WalletService` | `refreshBalances()` — `wallet_service.dart:307` | libwallet `getAssets()` |
| **Dashboard token list** (`_assets`, every token row) | `WalletDashboard` widget | its own `_loadData()` — `wallet_dashboard.dart:97` | libwallet `getAssets()` |

**Critical distinction:** `refreshBalances()` updates the headline **only**. It
does **not** reload the dashboard token list. The token list reloads only via
`_loadData()`, which is triggered by `swapCommittedTick`, a `txHistoryUpdates`
event, or pull-to-refresh.

### Trigger sources

**App-driven (immediate)** — an action explicitly calls one of:
- `refreshBalances()` — headline only.
- `notifyTxCommitted()` — `wallet_service.dart:209` → bumps `swapCommittedTick`
  **and** calls `refreshBalances()`. This is the only app call that refreshes
  **both** layers (the `swapCommittedTick` listener at `wallet_dashboard.dart:54`
  → `_onTxCommitted` `:62` → `_loadData`). It also schedules **delayed**
  refreshes (~3s, ~9s) — see "Confirmation latency" below.

### Confirmation latency (important)

A send/swap call returns at **broadcast** time, not confirmation. On Solana the
balance/token state doesn't reflect the tx for **~2-5s** after broadcast, so an
*immediate* refresh can read pre-confirmation (stale) data, and libwallet's own
`balanceChanges`/`txHistoryUpdates` events are poller-driven (~60s).

`notifyTxCommitted()` therefore refreshes **now** (catches anything already
settled) **and** schedules delayed re-refreshes at ~3s and ~9s so the confirmed
state lands quickly without waiting on the poller. These are scheduled at the
**service** level so they survive the originating screen being popped (e.g. the
send screen closes on success, so a `Future.delayed` on the send screen's State
would never fire).

The same delay schedule (`kTxConfirmationDelays`) and the re-poll loop are
shared via `lib/services/tx_confirmation.dart`:
- **Constant `kTxConfirmationDelays`** (`[3s, 9s]`) — used by both
  `notifyTxCommitted` (service-level, guarded by `isConnected`) and the mixin.
- **Mixin `TxConfirmationRefresh<T> on State<T>`** — `refreshAfterTx(reload)`
  runs a screen-local reload now + at each delay, guarded by `mounted`. Used by
  screens that stay mounted after the action and need to re-pull their *own*
  data: the swap screen (`_loadHoldings`) and the staking screen
  (`_loadUserStake`). Pairs with `notifyTxCommitted()` (which handles balances +
  the dashboard token list).

**Two correct patterns** for a post-tx refresh — use one, never a bare
immediate `refreshBalances()`:
1. **`notifyTxCommitted()`** — refresh now + delayed re-polls (3s/9s) + dashboard
   bump. Preferred; works even when the screen pops.
2. **confirm-then-refresh** — `await rpc.confirmTransaction(sig)` then refresh.
   Blocks the success UI a few seconds but is exact. Pair with `notifyTxCommitted()`
   (not bare `refreshBalances()`) so the dashboard is bumped too.

#### Per-path confirmation status

| Action | Confirmation-aware? | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Send | ✅ | `notifyTxCommitted()` (immediate + 3s/9s) — `send_screen.dart` |
| Swap | ✅ | `notifyTxCommitted()` + `refreshAfterTx(_loadHoldings)` (mixin) — `swap_screen.dart` |
| dApp / WC / browser tx | ✅ | `notifyTxCommitted()` via bridge `onTxCommitted` |
| Burn (incinerator) | ✅ | `await _rpc.confirmTransaction(sig)` then `notifyTxCommitted()` — `incinerator_screen.dart` |
| Staking (stake/unstake/claim) | ✅ | `notifyTxCommitted()` + `refreshAfterTx(_loadUserStake)` (mixin) — `staking_detail_screen.dart` |
| Token add/remove | N/A | local libwallet token-table op, no on-chain tx |
| Switch wallet/account, create/import | N/A | no tx broadcast; reads the wallet's existing balance |

> **Checklist for any new tx-broadcasting action:** refresh via
> `notifyTxCommitted()` (or confirm-then-`notifyTxCommitted`). Never a bare
> immediate `refreshBalances()` — it reads pre-confirmation state and skips the
> dashboard token list.
- a screen-local reload (`_loadTokens()`, `_loadAll()`, `_loadUserStake()`,
  `_load()`) that only refreshes that screen's own list.

**libwallet-driven (reactive safety net, ~60 s poller or on libwallet's own send)**:
- `balanceChanges` event → backend `balanceTick++` (`libwallet_backend.dart:376`)
  → `WalletService._onBalanceTick` (`wallet_service.dart:427`) → `refreshBalances()`
  (headline).
- `txHistoryUpdates` event → dashboard subscription (`wallet_dashboard.dart:76`)
  → `_loadData()` (token list).

On a wallet/account switch, `_onBackendChanged` (`wallet_service.dart:410`)
detects the address change and calls `resetSessionState()`
(`wallet_service.dart:161`) which **zeros** the headline balances; the fresh
values come from a subsequent `refreshBalances()` (e.g. via `useLibwallet()`)
or the next `balanceTick`.

### Rule of thumb

> To refresh **both** layers immediately after an action, call
> `wallet.notifyTxCommitted()`. Calling only `refreshBalances()` leaves the
> dashboard token list stale until the libwallet poller / tx-history event fires.

## 3. Gaps

### Gap 1 — Send doesn't reload the dashboard token list

- **Where:** `send_screen.dart:314` — on a successful broadcast it calls
  `wallet.refreshBalances();` (headline only), then shows the success modal and
  pops.
- **Symptom:** after sending an **SPL token** (e.g. USDT), the headline SOL
  updates immediately, but that token's **row in the dashboard token list lags**
  until libwallet's `txHistoryUpdates` / `balanceChanges` event fires (or the
  user pull-to-refreshes). Native SOL sends look fine because SOL *is* the
  headline.
- **Cause:** the dashboard token list reloads only on `swapCommittedTick` /
  `txHistoryUpdates`; `refreshBalances()` bumps neither.
- **Inconsistency:** Swap (`swap_screen.dart:649`) does this correctly via
  `notifyTxCommitted()`.
- **Fix:** in `send_screen.dart`, replace `wallet.refreshBalances();` with
  `wallet.notifyTxCommitted();` (which refreshes the headline **and** bumps
  `swapCommittedTick` so the dashboard reloads its token list). Because the send
  returns at broadcast time, `notifyTxCommitted()` also schedules delayed
  re-refreshes (~3s, ~9s) at the service level so the confirmed balance lands
  even though the send screen has popped — see "Confirmation latency".

### Gap 2 — dApp / WalletConnect / browser transactions get no app-side refresh

- **Where:** `libwallet_request_bridge.dart:105` — after
  `await client.requests.approve(req.id, keys: keys);` there is no
  `refreshBalances()` / `notifyTxCommitted()`.
- **Symptom:** a transaction approved from a dApp (WalletConnect or the in-app
  browser) changes balances, but neither the headline nor the token list updates
  until the libwallet poller (~60 s) catches it.
- **Cause:** the bridge only signs/submits; nothing notifies `WalletService`.
- **Fix:** after a successful **transaction-type** `approve` (not message-sign /
  add-network / chain-switch), call `wallet.notifyTxCommitted()`. Message-sign
  needs nothing (no on-chain change). Chain-switch already routes through
  `_onBackendChanged` for the network change but may still show stale balances
  until the next refresh — consider a `refreshBalances()` there too.

### Gap 3 — Burn / stake / token-CRUD refresh their own screen but not the dashboard

- **Where:** `incinerator_screen.dart:409/578/783`,
  `staking_detail_screen.dart:417/465/608`,
  `tokens_screen.dart:118/146/190`.
- **Symptom:** these reload their own list (`_loadTokens`/`_loadAll` /
  `_loadUserStake` / `_load`) and call `refreshBalances()` (headline), but the
  **dashboard** token list isn't bumped, so on return it can be briefly stale.
- **Severity:** low — the user is on the action screen during the action, and
  the dashboard self-heals via the poller / tx-history event.
- **✅ Staking fixed (was a Gap 1-class hole).** Previously
  `staking_detail_screen.dart` called `_loadUserStake()` + `refreshBalances()`
  **immediately after broadcast** — no confirm, no delayed re-poll — so stake
  figures/balance could read pre-confirmation and stay stale until the ~60s
  poller. Now all three handlers route through `_refreshAfterStakeTx()`, which
  calls `notifyTxCommitted()` (balances + dashboard + 3s/9s delayed) **and**
  re-runs `_loadUserStake()` on the same 3s/9s schedule (the staking screen
  stays mounted, so it can).
- **✅ Burn fixed:** the three incinerator burn paths now call
  `notifyTxCommitted()` instead of `refreshBalances()` (they already
  `confirmTransaction` first, so timing was correct — this adds the dashboard
  bump). Own-list `_loadTokens()`/`_loadAll()` unchanged.
- **✅ Token-CRUD fixed:** add/remove now call the new
  `WalletService.notifyTokenListChanged()` after `_load()` — a one-shot
  dashboard + headline refresh with **no** confirmation re-polls (it's a local
  table op, nothing to wait for), so a newly-tracked token shows on the
  dashboard immediately.

### Gap 4 — Lifecycle is not reported, so resume-from-background doesn't fast-refresh — ✅ FIXED

- **Was:** the app never called `client.lifecycle.update(...)` except inside the
  device-transfer screens, so after returning from background the poller's
  "poll immediately on resume" optimization never fired and balances could stay
  stale for up to the full ~60 s poll interval.
- **Fix:** `TibaneShellState` (`main.dart`) is now a `WidgetsBindingObserver`;
  `didChangeAppLifecycleState` reports `foreground` (resumed) / `background`
  (paused/detached/hidden) via the new `WalletService.reportLifecycle(status)`
  (best-effort `client.lifecycle.update`). `inactive` is skipped (transient).
  libwallet defaults to active, so only transitions are reported — no initial
  report needed. The one-off `lifecycle.update('foreground')` calls in the
  device-transfer send screen + `importViaDeviceTransfer` were removed (the
  app-wide reporting + libwallet's default-active state cover the pairing).

## 4. Recommended priority — all done ✅

1. **Gap 1** (send → `notifyTxCommitted`) — ✅ done.
2. **Gap 2** (dApp tx → `notifyTxCommitted`) — ✅ done.
3. **Gap 4** (app-wide lifecycle reporting) — ✅ done (`WidgetsBindingObserver`
   in `TibaneShellState` → `WalletService.reportLifecycle`; device-transfer
   foreground one-offs removed).
4. **Gap 3** (burn/stake/token-CRUD) — ✅ done (staking + burn →
   `notifyTxCommitted`; token-CRUD → `notifyTokenListChanged`).
